		<p>Covid-19 has caused misery and loss everywhere, but its damaging power has been felt particularly strongly by the incarcerated, who have been infected at rates several times higher than those of their surrounding communities.</p>

		<p>When David was imprisoned last year, he knew he would be losing his freedom, but what he didn’t anticipate was that he would spend almost the entirety of his sentence confined to his cell, effectively without visits and rehabilitation activities, due to a virus that would tear through prisons.</p>

		<p>“Having one hour out of my cell every day made me rethink my entire existence,” says David, not his real name, who was released last month.</p>

		<p>“Many chapters of my life crossed my mind and made me reconsider everything I had done wrong, but I also felt lonely, depressed and anxious most of the time,” he says.</p>

		<p>David spent half of his time in HMP Brixton, South London, where over half of the prison’s inmates are known to have been infected by the disease. In Cardiff prison, a third of the prisoners would be infected at the peak of the pandemic. </p>

		<p>The old and cramped prison system in England and Wales was at high risk of becoming a coronavirus hotspot.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="second_page_body">
		<p>Many prisons in England and Wales are overcrowded, the Victorian buildings make social distancing almost impossible, adult prisoners tend to have poor physical and mental health and in the last two decades, the proportion of older prisoners has increased significantly.</p>

		<p>Even before the pandemic, the House of Commons Justice Committee had said the prison system was in a “crisis of safety and decency”.</p>

		<p>Since 2012, violent incidents have risen sharply in England and Wales. In the 12 months to March 2020, an average week saw at least one prisoner commit suicide and thousands of incidents of assault and self-harm.</p>

		<p>“The grossly underfunded and overcrowded prison system was very vulnerable to an outbreak of infection, and that hasn't changed,” says Peter Dawson, ex-governor and director of the Prison Reform Trust.</p>

		<p>Overcrowding, where prisoners had to share cells designed for one person, ranged from 22% to 47% of the prison population.</p>

		<p>“How can you socially distance in an environment like this?” says Nick Hardwick, Professor of Criminal Justice at Royal Holloway University and former Chief Inspector of Prisons for England and Wales.</p>

		<p>“You would think these are the perfect environment for the virus to spread and the population who would be vulnerable to it. For this reason, when the virus struck, the predictions about what would happen, predictions I shared, were dire,” Hardwick says.</p>

		<p>At the end of April 2020, Public Health England suggested that in a worst-case scenario, 77,800 prisoners could become infected, 4,500 hospitalised and 2,700 die if nothing was done.</p>

		<p>Outcomes were far better than projected in the first wave of the pandemic — but at a heavy cost for prisoners.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="third_page_body">
		<p>By the end of August, there had been 27 deaths of prisoners where they either tested positive for Covid-19 or it was thought to be a contributory factor.</p>

		<p>During the peak of the first wave in April 2020, the community accounted for a higher death rate than prisons — 52 in 100,000 in the general population and 21 in 100,000 in prisons.</p>

		<p>The rate of infection was slightly higher in prisons during the first wave peak, with a rate of 374 in 100,000 in prisons and 212 in 100,000 in the community.</p>

		<p>As in the general UK population, older prisoners appeared most at risk from the virus but unlike in the community, prisoners from Black, Asian and other ethnic groups did not appear to be disproportionately affected.</p>

		<p>“Although infection rates have been higher than in the community, it has not been nearly as dramatically as people expected, but that's because a staggeringly high percentage of prisoners have spent almost all of the last 12 months confined to a cell for almost all of every day to a completely unprecedented degree,” Dawson says.</p>

		<p>A day after the United Kingdom went into its first national lockdown on 23 March 2020, it was announced that all prisoners were to spend most of the day in their cells.</p>

		<p>Infected prisoners were isolated. Work, education and rehabilitation activities were almost completely halted and visits from family or friends were stopped.</p>

		<p>Although prisons were 97% full at the start of lockdown, numbers started to fall due to ordinary releases and a slowdown in new arrivals caused by slower or suspended court proceedings. </p>

		<p>In the second wave, the virus spread much faster than in the community and many prisoners did not survive.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="fourth_page_body">
		<p>After a summer free of Covid-19 prison deaths, the data started to head into the wrong direction when the second wave of the pandemic hit Britain in the autumn.</p>

		<p>In the second wave, a better prepared prison service strengthened control measures. There was an increase in routine testing of staff, reception testing of prisoners, mass testing during outbreaks and a wastewater testing pilot.</p>

		<p>But prisoners kept getting sick.</p>

		<p>The infection rate climbed faster inside the prisons than outside. By January, England and Wales had close to 2,000 cases per 100,000, while the rate inside prisons was over 6,000 cases.</p>

		<p>“In the first wave, quite a lot of prisoners managed to avoid infection altogether remarkably,” Dawson says. “Most prisons have had an outbreak in the second one. I think that probably has to do with the nature of the virus, which like in the community, it appears that new variants have spread much more easily.”</p>

		<p>The government’s scientific advisors, the SAGE committee, said the higher rate in prisons might be explained by variants or by “a degree of fatigue with control measures”.</p>

		<p>“The situation at Brixton was bad,” remembers David, who spent several months there last year after being transferred from HMP Sutton. “So many prisoners got sick, doctors were everywhere and I could hear ambulances all the time.”</p>

		<p>In HMP Cardiff, a third of the roughly 800 prisoners contracted Covid-19. Social distancing was a formidable hurdle in a structure built in 1832.</p>

		<p>“Although temporary accommodation has been introduced in some sites to reduce the number of prisoners sharing cells, there isn’t any at Cardiff [prison] because there is not enough space outside,” says Sarah Rigby, the Prison Officer Association’s South West and South Wales area representative.</p>

		<p>There was also less staff to manage the crisis. Covid-19 meant prisons in England and Wales had a record number of staff absences from April to October 2020.</p>

		<p>“Cardiff for a while had about 14 prison officers from Swansea drafted in to support them for three to four weeks,” says Rigby. “This is good but also alien to the concept that you shouldn't be bringing new people from a different area into the prison.”</p>

		<p>“The Early Release Scheme was bound to fail from the start,” Dawson says. “No one when they saw the scheme as it was written expected that it would produce anything like 4,000 releases because that would have been politically unwelcome.”</p>

		<p>“I think the answer to why it hasn't been restarted in the second wave is that prison numbers have fallen due to the courts not operating normally,” says Dawson.</p>

		<p>“There hasn't been either the death rate or the incidence of disorder within prisons that ministers were worried about when they finally agreed to set up a scheme in the first place, but both of those seem to me to be wholly inadequate reasons,” he says.</p>

		<p>Incarcerated people have not been given priority to be inoculated, though they have an elevated risk of infection and death. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="fifth_page_body">
		<p>Despite calls by charities and scientists, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation decided that, unlike care homes, prisons would not be prioritised for the vaccinations, stating that they would be appropriately distributed by age rather by risk of infection.</p>

		<p>Last March, a UCL-led team of researchers also called for the prison population to be made a vaccine priority. They suggested that prisoners are at an increased risk of Covid-19, with a death rate over three times higher than that of the general population.</p>

		<p>A SAGE report on Covid-19 transmissibility said that severe restrictions could be lifted much quicker if the vaccine was rolled out faster than currently planned.</p>

		<p>“Universal vaccination for prisoners and staff as a priority group would provide a strong defence against that and reduce or avoid the need for the measures that do so much damage to mental health and the prospects for successful resettlement,” says Dawson.</p>

		<p>“If the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation agrees with SAGE, it’s hard to see any possible reason for the government not to take the advice,” he says.</p>

		<p>As the backlog in the courts is reduced, prisoner occupancy levels will rise and maintaining the current control measures may become harder. “It’s going to go down like a wave and hit prisons,” Hardwick says. “I’m really worried about the effect of that.” </p>

		<p>With twenty-three hours locked inside their cells, campaigners worry prisoners’ mental health is at risk of irreparable damage.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="fifth_page_body">
		<p>Although the restrictions are likely to have saved thousands of lives, surveys have indicated that spending up to 23 hours a day in a cell, losing visits from partners and children and stopping all work and training has hurt prisoners’ mental health.</p>

		<p>“The most disturbing effect of the restrictions was the decline in prisoners’ emotional, psychological and physical well-being,” said Charlie Taylor, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons, in a report from last February.</p>

		<p>“They were chronically bored and exhausted by spending hours locked in their cells,” said Taylor, who observed that prisoners’ mental and physical health were, sometimes visibly, in decline, and that their despondency, resentment and lack of hope for the future was especially notable.    “They frequently compared themselves to caged animals. As one prisoner said: ‘It’s like being imprisoned while you’re in prison’,” he said.</p>

		<p>A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said that throughout the pandemic, "decisive action has saved the lives of thousands" and inmates are let out of their cells for longer when local restrictions allow.</p>

		<p>Public Health England stopped in-person visits at prisons in England and Wales on 24 March last year without exception until 6 July, when some prisons were able to reopen under strict guidelines.</p>

		<p>However, some prisoners were not able to receive visits until September or later. HMP Leicester did not reopen until 26 October, just 11 days before it was locked down again.</p>

		<p>Research from the University of Oxford has estimated that more than 300,000 children in England and Wales have a parent in prison each year, and many of these children have not had any face-to-face contact with their parent since early March 2020.</p>

		<p>Since March 2021 English and Welsh prisons where infection levels are ‘under control’ have been able to resume social visits for the first time in months.</p>

		<p>Strengthening relationships with their family and friends can support prisoners’ successful release back into the community and reduce the likelihood of further offending. The Inspectorate of Prisons said prisoners found the lack of visits from their families for months at a time difficult to cope with.</p>

		<p>However, the introduction of free video calling and the continuing installation of in-cell phones were valued by prisoners, the Inspectorate said.</p>

		<p>“Prisoners have seen drastic changes to their daily routines to save lives and to protect local health services,” said Prisons Minister Lucy Frazer in a statement last January. “Part of that has been the loss of social visits – something we know plays a huge role in prisoners’ wellbeing and rehabilitation and these calls are allowing them to keep this vital family contact.” </p>

		<p>Self-harm rates decreased in male prisons after a decade of an upward trend — but rose slightly in women’s jails.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="fifth_page_body">
		<p>In the 12 months to March 2021, 79 prisoners took their own lives, which meant the downward trend of recent years continued. Assaults dropped by a third during the pandemic.</p>

		<p>However, Dawson suggests these figures may not represent the real picture as incidents might have been underreported. 
	</p>

		<p>“If you look at how self-harm incidents are recorded in prisons normally, a significant percentage of them are recorded by teachers, psychologists, volunteers, prisoner peer workers, and they haven't been going in,” Dawson says. “I think we don’t understand what’s actually been happening.”</p>

		<p>“The week leading up to Easter I had a period of depression and had seriously considered harming myself,” a prisoner told the Prison Reform Trust last June. “Staff here were completely unaware and it wasn’t until my concerned mother phoned the prison any action was taken.”</p>

		<p>David, however, remembers staff checking up on him on a regular basis. “There were days when I didn’t eat and all I did was sleep,” he says. “Officers worried about my mental health and would ask me if I was okay or if I needed to see a doctor.”</p>

		<p>Andrew Forrester, a professor of forensic psychiatry at Cardiff University who has done extensive research on mental health in the criminal justice system, says that many prisoners might be suffering in silence.</p>

		<p>“A problem in prison is that it can be difficult for people to know what is going on,” he says. “A lot of prisoners are suffering in silence but not telling anybody about it, which makes it difficult to judge the full extent of problems they have.”</p>

		<p>“In a prison setting where there are problems with gang activity, coercion and threatening behaviour, the strengthened control lockdown posed might have had an effect on self-harm rates,” says Forrester.</p>

		<p>“It may be that things were so bad that the restriction or regimes made an appalling situation slightly less appalling,” Dawson says.</p>

		<p>However, prisoners told HM Inspectorate of Prisons that violence, intimidation and bullying had not stopped, but had instead taken other forms.</p>

		<p>“The accrual of debt persisted, and some had turned to using drugs as a way of managing their isolation and boredom,” the Inspectorate said. They believed the current restrictions could not last indefinitely and were therefore worried about a future resurgence in physical assaults.</p>

		<p>Lockdown restrictions also ended most of the education and training opportunities that reduce reoffending.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="fifth_page_body">
		<p>A representative by the Clink Charity, an organisation which aims to cut reoffending by providing hospitality training to prisoners, said that they had not been able to properly train any of their students throughout the past year.</p>

		<p>“When restrictions have eased and prisons have allowed our students to take part in training, we have soon after had to lockdown again,” the charity said.</p>

		<p>The halt to rehabilitation could mean fewer people getting released when they should, Dawson warns. “The opportunity as a prisoner to show that you can be trusted and that you are taking a constructive approach to your prison time has all disappeared,” he says.</p>

		<p>The Inspectorate said that the prospect of release into a world drastically different as a result of Covid-19 restrictions caused prisoners significant anxiety. </p>

		<p>The future prison landscape is uncertain, but some are hopeful that it will rebuild better and stronger.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="fifth_page_body">
		<p>Although efforts to contain the spread of the virus were initially successful, they have come at a heavy cost to prisoners. The long-term effect of the absence of rehabilitation and being locked up for over 22 hours every day, often without company, is likely to be significant and far-reaching.</p>

		<p>The Inspectorate called into question whether the right balance had been achieved between managing the risk posed by Covid-19 and providing prisoners with enough meaningful activity and time outside their cells.</p>

		<p>In the midst of the profound impact this crisis is likely to have on prisoners in the long run, and with opportunities such as a whole-prison approach to vaccinations and an effective early release scheme being missed, people familiar with the current prison system say that the post-pandemic ‘new normal’ could be a catalyst for change.</p>

		<p>“We need to reflect very carefully about what has happened,” says Hardwick. “It may be that we won’t be able to understand it for some time, but I certainly think that there is an opportunity to change. We can’t just go back to the appalling situation that there was before. We can’t go back to that level of violence.”</p>

		<p>As the prison service rebuilds after the pandemic, there is hope that conversations about how to lay a vision for a safer prison community will be held.</p>

		<p>“Is it a moment for change? It might be, crisis often is,” says Dawson. “The optimists will say, well, the National Health Service was created during the Second World War.” </p>
